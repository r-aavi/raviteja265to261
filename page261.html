This chapter discusses the needs and opportunities for teaching compre-<br>hensive business applications, Enterprise <br>Systems, in the form of academic<br>
distance education courses. Specific factors of the educational market in<br>
Enterprise Systems such as high demand, limited resources or the increased<br>
importance of Application Hosting Centers will be described. An appropriate<br>
learning model will be selected that stresses the role of the lecturer as a<br>
moderator. The subject, Process Engineering at Queensland University of<br>
Technology, is taken as an example in order to discuss different forms of<br>
distance and also collaborative education in Enterprise Systems. The sum-<br>mary includes recommendations and sketches<br> possible future directions.<br>

<h3>Characteristics of Enterprise Systems</h3><br>
A new class of packaged application software has emerged over the past<br>
decade. Variously called Enterprise Resource Planning Systems, Enterprise-<br>wide Systems, Enterprise Business Systems <br>or just Enterprise Systems, these<br>

comprehensive software solutions seek to integrate the complete range of a<br>
business’s processes and functions in order to present a holistic view of the<br>
business from a single information and IT architecture. An Enterprise System<br>
can be defined as customizable standard software that supports the main<br>
business processes of a company (Rosemann, 1999).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As off-the-shelf solutions, they consist of integrated applications for the<br>
main functions, such as procurement, production management, warehousing,<br>
sales and distribution, financial and managerial accounting, human resource<br>
management and quality management. In the most cases, industry-specific<br>
solutions are available, which include applications demanded by industries<br>
such as aerospace, automotive, banking, chemicals, consumer products,<br>
engineering, healthcare, higher education, insurance, mining, oil and gas,<br>
pharmaceuticals, retail, telecommunications or utilities. Enterprise Systems<br>
are based on one integrated logical database. Consequently, vendor master<br>
data entered in the materials management module are, for example, also<br>
available in the accounts payable module. Enterprise Systems have one<br>
common user interface across all modules that can be individualized for users<br>
or user groups.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the main Enterprise Systems vendors are SAP, J.D. Edwards,<br>
Oracle and PeopleSoft. Among these, SAP solutions are the dominant<br>
application, claiming more than 50 % of the Enterprise Systems market. The<br>
Gartner Group forecasts that the Enterprise Systems market will be greater<br>
than $20 billion by 2002 (with a probability of 80%) (Gartner Group, 1999).<br>
According to their prediction, more than 50% of this will be Enterprise<br>
Systems service revenue, while the total Enterprise Systems license revenue<br>
will amount to about $9 billion. The Gartner Group also estimates that more<br>
than 90% of Fortune 500 enterprises have purchased a module or a set of<br>
modules from an Enterprise Systems vendor. The market for small- and<br>
medium-sized enterprises is identified as the main customer group, as more<br>
than 50% of these enterprises have not yet selected a next-generation<br>
Enterprise Systems. For 2001 (2002), the Gartner Group predicts market<br>
growth of 25% (28%). These figures show that Enterprise Systems initiatives<br>
are among the biggest investments to which enterprises are currently commiting. This trend is likely to continue <br>as a second wave of Enterprise Systems<br>
(ERP II) is emerging, which extends these systems towards interbusiness<br>
processes such as Customer Relationship Management and Supply Chain<br>
Management (Gartner Group, 2000).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A range of influences has encouraged the increasing uptake of Enterprise<br>
Systems, which already account for a substantial portion of the world-<br>installed base of application software

ing the adoption of “best practices,” the paradigm of continuous business<br>
engineering postulated by the large management consulting firms, and an<br>
international trend towards privatization of government services, have all<br>
contributed to a climate of change that has facilitated the growing acceptance<br>
and adoption of Enterprise Systems. The global rush to deploy information<br>
technology in support of re-engineering and rightsizing the firm demands<br>
both substantial and relatively rapid change to the information systems<br>
portfolio, a pace of change not possible with custom software development.<br>
The backlog in IS departments, problems integrating systems, the inability of<br>
legacy systems to cope with the “Year 2000” problem, and the introduction<br>
of the Euro currency have further increased demand for application software<br>
packages. Enterprise Systems are used because they allow a cost-effective,<br>
company-wide integration of data and processes.<br><br><br><br>
<h2>Brief Overview about Enterprise Systems Education at<br>
Universities</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a significant and growing proportion of Information Systems<br>
graduates are integrally involved with the selection, implementation,<br>
operation, maintenance, support, management, development and use of<br>
software packages, Enterprise Systems as a distinct phenomenon of<br>
interest remain largely under-researched and absent in Information Man-<br>agement and Information Systems curricula <br>(Gable, 1998; Klaus et al.,<br>
2000). Paradoxically, a serious dearth of Enterprise Systems expertise<br>
exists in practice. This shortage in supply contributes to heated competi-<br>tion for staff with related experience, <br>project budget-overruns, and over-<br>reliance on external consultants and contractors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universities started quite late with the integration of Enterprise Systems-<br>related subjects into their curriculum.<br> A main facilitator for the integration of<br>
Enterprise Systems is the range of university programs of the major Enterprise<br>
Systems vendors. This university to Enterprise Systems vendor link has<br>
spawned new curricula at the post-graduate level, either under the banner of<br>
a new breed of MBA program (Winter, 1999), or within the Information<br>
Systems area as a Master of Science program (Holmes and Hayen, 1999b).<br>
Individual experiences of universities implementing SAP R/3 into their IS<br>
curriculum can be found in Lederer-Antonucci (1999), Watson and Schneider<br>
(1999). Foote (1999) describes a SAP-accounting class and other SAP-related<br>
courses in the U.S. Shoemaker (1999) sketches a six-hour introduction to<br>
Enterprise Systems for sales and marketing professionals. Rosemann et al.<br>
(2000) and Hawking and McCarthy (2000) discuss Enterprise Systems<br>
courses with industrial work experiences.<br><br><br><br><br>







<h3 align="right">Teaching Enterprise Systems in a Distance Education Mode</h3>
The impact of reorganizing Enterprise Systems subject matter into<br>
existing curricula and the special challenges posed to faculty has been<br>
reported by Stewart et al. (1999). The benefits and pitfalls of teaching<br>
conceptual knowledge with Enterprise Systems as a learning vehicle have<br>
been critically evaluated in terms of learning outcomes and effort by Noguera<br>
and Watson (1999) and Scott (1999).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of a syllabus for the remote delivery of an introductory<br>
subject via the Internet is given by Holmes and Hayen (1999a). They<br>
describe the design of a course consisting of ten lessons that introduces the<br>
concepts, fundamentals and framework of Enterprise Systems (see also<br>
http://sap.mis.cmich.edu/sap-esoft00.htm). The main teaching tools were<br>
HTML-based websites generated from PowerPoint slides, Lotus Screen<br>
Cams and a web-based discussion forum. Stewart and Rosemann (2001)<br>
propose an increased international collaboration at universities in order to<br>
educate in the area of Enterprise Systems more cost-effectively.<br>
In comparison with its dominance in industry, SAP is also the most<br>
popular Enterprise System in use at universities. A worldwide survey about<br>
teaching and research related to SAP R/3 showed that most universities<br>
(outside Germany) started in or after 1997 with their initiatives in Enterprise<br>
Systems (Gable & Rosemann, 1999). Since then, it has become an area of fast-<br>growing interest in academia <br>demonstrated by the continuously increasing<br>
number of subjects dealing with Enterprise Systems. The international<br>
survey, for example, consolidated data about more than 180 SAP-related<br>
subjects at universities. In the U.S., until 1997 almost no university was<br>
teaching SAP R/3, while in 2001 more than 200 institutes of higher learning<br>
are using SAP solutions. Most of these universities report a significant<br>
increase in enrolments due to their SAP offerings. SAP’s Enterprise System<br>
R/3, as an example, is used worldwide by more than 400 universities in more<br>
than 35 countries and more than 50,000 students access this solution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, research in Enterprise Systems is rapidly developing. In<br>
2000, all major conferences on Information Systems (ICIS, AMCIS,<br>
ACIS, PACIS, ECIS) had a special track on Enterprise Systems. The<br>
Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS) has, since 1999,<br>
a special track on Enterprise Systems that regularly includes papers on<br>
teaching Enterprise Systems (e.g., Holmes & Hayen, 1999a; 1999b;<br>
Noguera & Watson, 1999; Stewart et al., 1999; Rosemann et al., 2000).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, many academic IS journals had special editions on Enter-<br>prise Systems in 2000 (e.g., Journal of <br>Information Technology, Information<br>
Systems Frontiers, Communications of the ACM, Journal of Decision Sys-<br>tems, Journal of Management Information <br>Systems, Business Process Man-<br>agement Journal, Australian Accounting Review).<br>
